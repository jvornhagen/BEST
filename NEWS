CHANGES IN v.0.1.1

  * BESTmcmc has 'verbose' argument; setting verbose = FALSE (or 0) suppresses
	output to the Console (wish of Ben Marwick).

  * BESTpower also has 'verbose' argument; here verbose = 0 (or FALSE) 
	suppresses all output, verbose = 1 (or TRUE) provides just a progress bar;
	verbose = 2 (the default) displays full details.
